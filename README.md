# How the app works

   We have two user roles:
    
   ### `Admin`
   - logs in to the app 
   - manages and register students of the institute
   - manages users.
   - Creates a promotion for each major.
   - Divides each promotion into groups and arrange students in those groups
   - Assigns to each course the teacher user responsible for it and a promotion
   - After grading students by teacher users, results and averages will be automatically generated
      and presented to the admin in conveniently organized tables.
   ### `Teacher`
   - logs in to the app
   - selects one of the courses he was assigned to, an evaluation type, and one 
      of the groups of students enrolled in the selected course
   - submits students grades
